           <h3>Spiritual and Scientific</h3>
           <p>
            <h4>Soul of Yoga is the place where Harvard meets Hogwarts!

            In recent years the therapeutic effectiveness of complimentary treatments such as yoga, breathwork, meditation, sound healing and energy healing has gained attention from the scientific community. These interventions have been proven to have measurable effects on our mind and emotional states as well as on a physiological level. As such Soul of Yoga’s faculty includes Western experts speaking to modern understanding, including geneticists, neuroscientists, psychologists, researchers, cardiac and oncology experts, and behavioral specialists.
            
            For all that modern science has come to understand about yogic science, there still remains teaching that is shrouded in mystery. At Soul of Yoga, we invite you to delve into these ancient mysteries and philosophies by studying with experienced teachers who are mystics, philosophers, authors and healers as they unveil the deep wisdom of subtle anatomy, Ayurveda, Sound Healing, Reiki and the ancient texts.
            
            We have the highest respect for both science and spirit and the Soul of Yoga shines in the convergence point</h4>
        </p>
         <h3>World Renowned Faculty and Master Teachers</h3>
         <p>
            <h4>Whether teaching asana, science or mysticism, Soul of Yoga’s faculty are renowned throughout the yoga community for their depth of knowledge and unwavering commitment to preserving the authentic lineage of yoga.
